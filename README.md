# Hi there, I'm 🌟 bright-curate

bright-curate is a fun project where I combine my background in design 🎨 and my journey into backend development 💻. The idea is simple: curate and serve creative resources — like color palettes, design inspirations, or project ideas — through a lightweight backend app.

🚀 Features

🎨 Generate and serve curated color palettes for designers & devs

📦 Simple API endpoints (/palette/random) returning JSON

🛠️ Built to be lightweight, scalable, and extendable

🔮 Future expansion: curated design tips, project ideas, or templates
